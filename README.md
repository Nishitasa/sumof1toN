A smart elevator, refers to an elevator system that incorporates advanced technologies to enhance efficiency, safety, and user experience. These elevators utilize various sensors, algorithms, and connectivity features to improve their performance and functionality. These elevators are particularly beneficial in high-traffic buildings where efficient vertical transportation is crucial. Key features of smart elevators include:
Traffic Analysis and Optimization

Security and Access Control

Energy Efficiency
